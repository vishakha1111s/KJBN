## Getting Started
Developer Details -Vishakha Dikshit
This project list the available buses. In this project we are showing departure, arrival time, available seats, bus name, trip duration and bus id.
I did not found open api for listing public transport so to illustrate how the code would interact with an API, I created commented-out code sections that call a dummy API and used hardcoded json.
Added user permission to access location.
