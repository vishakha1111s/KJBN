# untitled

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project list the available buses. In this project we are showing departure, arrival time, available seats.
I did not found open api for listing public transport so to illustrate how the code would interact with an API, I created commented-out code sections that call a dummy API and used hardcoded json.
